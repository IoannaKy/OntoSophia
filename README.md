# OntoSophia
The 'OntoSophia' ontology is written in OWL 2 DL. Its scope is to enable the formal characterization of propositions, arguments, and quoted elements within the argumentative discussion in philosophical texts. Its structure follows the conceptual division between abstract arguments, abstract propositions and their expressions in texts, aiming to facilitate the representation of this division. This division enables to capture the cases where a restatement of an argument or proposition or a reference to the same argument or proposition occurs.
