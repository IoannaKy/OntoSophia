The scope of the ‘OntoSophia’ ontology is to enable the formal characterisation of propositions, arguments and quoted elements within the argumentative discussion in philosophical texts. Its structure follows the conceptual division between abstract arguments, abstract propositions and their expressions in texts, aiming to facilitate the representation of this division. This model enables to capture the cases where a restatement of an argument or proposition or a reference to the same argument or proposition occurs.</span>
